# Weather-Monitoring-system
Data(temperature &amp; Humidity) collect from the DHT-11 sensor
Sent the data to a remote server(thingspeak)
Live data monitoring 
Deep sleep mode for esp32 Time and Date collect from NTPC Server
Store data in My SQL Database


Specila Note...............
if you use nowmal NTPC library 
you got the date format error .... getFormattedDate()

To avoid this error delete NTPC library  and instal NTPClient-master Library
The easiest way to get date and time from an NTP server is using an NTP Client library. For that weâ€™ll be using the NTP Client library forked by Taranais. Follow the next steps to install this library in your Arduino IDE:

Click here( https://github.com/taranais/NTPClient) to download the NTP Client library. You should have a .zip folder in your Downloads
Unzip the .zip folder and you should get NTPClient-master folder
Rename your folder from NTPClient-master to NTPClient
Move the NTPClient folder to your Arduino IDE installation libraries folder
Finally, re-open your Arduino IDE
